# Preamble-Project

## We the people believe that opportunity, inclusion, and hope for the future, establish a more perfect union; not legislation, medication or further incarceration.

## Qualitative Goals
1. Bridge the skills gap by delivering readily available resources to provide the __applied digital skills training__ into our American prison systems, county jails, and juvenile detention centers.  Into the hands of our socioeconomically disadvantaged; a grossly under, and unemployed subsector of the US economy.
2. Leverage the same plant that, to this day, continues to be unjustly used to incarcerate over 600,000 Americans per year, as means to gainful employment, opportunity, economic stability, and improved pscyhe of the formerly incarcerated.
3. In making the problem the solution, the expected outcome is:
    - reduction of the illicit marijuana market
    - boost to the 
        - Medicinal, 
        - Recreational, and 
        - Whole herbaceous plant; hemp plant sector. 
    - added tax revenues from an uncollected and unresolved illicit marijuana market.

## Quantitative Goals
1. See Prohibition End
1. Realize 7 year exit strategy & conversion to not-for profit business model.
    - Long-term goal is help Draft The Opioid Epidemic Resolution after pivoting to full-time commitment on tackling the opioid / substance use epidemic. 
1. Facilitate creation of in-demand, high growth potential, well paying careers over the course of the next 7 years in
    - IT
    - Cannabis
    - Hemp Farm
        - possibly as stand alone or a fusion of all three.

### Non-Negotiables
1. Open source, open border, open for all as an always accessible, fully transparent repository on the github.com platform.
1.  All-inlcusive. Expect and respect diversity. A True Meritocracy.
1. Establish  and implement simple yet actionable measurables fueling data-driven Solutions.
1. Launch from Google Cloud Platform; full leverage of the platform and resources as to progressively deliver current and emerging technologies, utilize all that is machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, kubernetes, and Natural Language Processing. 
    
    - Chasing the Wind, llc has chosen to allocate all benefits from the Google Cloud for Startups program recently awarded are to be utilized in their entirety on the preamble-project, as a means to kickstart the launch, further extending while facilitating lean funding; simply put, a sustainable cannabis model.

## Will it work?

### [The Last Mile Project](https://thelastmile.org/), a framework and blueprint worthy of emulation, prepares incarcerated individuals for successful reentry through business and technology training.

Their motto:

  
  > **Changing Lives Through Tech**

## Using a four-pillar approach.

Education | Vocation | Expansion | Reentry
---|---|---|---
Simple | Attainable | Lean | Record of Success 
**Served 460 students since '10** | **12 locations Ca, In, Ks, Ok** | **0% recidivism rate** | **National Avg. 55%**

## The People Problems
### **IT and the Digital Skills Gap**
Cloud Services, IT, and Machine Learning  are developing at break-neck speeds while driving faster growth and efficiency for businesses and society, but there is a lack of digital skills in the workforce.

---

### **Recidivism / Reentry**
Recidivism rates are at their worst levels on Earth due to drug wars beginning to end, legislation finally recognizing the gross over-incarceration that's been in place for nearly 40 years. 

While what was already an 
- __overcrowded__
- __underfunded__
- __exhausted reentry/community supervision__ model.
    
A model that's original intention was to assist the formerly incarcerated and serve as a conduit back to some sense of normalcy. As the newly released struggle with strengthening their psyche and overcoming stigma disease. 

It is was not instituted to play the role it currently holds. As the doorstop for the turnstile right back into the American [in]Justice System. 

It is the epitome of an open door policy, more aptly put, a revolving door policy.

---

> The board of Pardons and Paroles and all fifty states Departments of Community Supervision front, maintenance, and back doors, have all been stuck in gear for the better part of fifty years; right in line with the passing of The Civil Rights Act of Nineteen Hundred and Sixy Four.

### **SUD & The Opioid Epidemic**
Making the connection with substance misuse, the opioid crisis, and recidivistic statistics is a simple Aristotle logic equation. 

Wars were claimed on Drugs. Non-violent, victimless crimes became felonious; carrying mandatory minimum discriminatory sentences. 

Causing addicts to become public enemy number one. 

In a socioeconmic war, that either, lost site of the intended target. Or never understood who to target from the onset.  

Each one is a seperate issue and seperately we continue to fail in fighting them. 

Once the string of logic is followed, the common threads become more obvious.

Those string can be seen tugging on the epidemic and substance use statistics. 
Their names; War on Drugs, and Stigma. 

---
> Preamble-Projoect is an impossible to refute evidence-based strategy establishing an absolute need for fighting the stigma disease. 
---

Finally, by bringing those problems together, the underlying issues (lack of opportunity / diminishing self-worth) will surface becoming more visible to the unaffected. Whis is the inertia we seek. Allowing for replinishment of opportunity and equality for all sub-sectors of American Citizens. This will certainly create a long-lasting domino effect tilting the tides to the favor of the people . While further weakening and helping fuel the fire that is going to bring America to Drug War Ends. Just as prohibition finds its end. And We the People continue on demanding actual actionable alternative answers.
