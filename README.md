Into the hands of our socioeconomically disadvantaged; a grossly under, and unemployed subsector of the US economy.
2. Leverage the same plant that, to this day, continues to be unjustly used to incarcerate over 600,000 Americans per year, as means to gainful employment, opportunity, economic stability, and improved pscyhe of the formerly incarcerated.
3. In making the problem the solution, the expected outcome is:
    - reduction of the illicit marijuana market

        - Medicinal, 
        - Recreational, and 
        - Whole herbaceous plant; hemp plant sector. 
    - added tax revenues from an uncollected and unresolved illicit marijuana market.

## Will it work?

### [The Last Mile Project](https://thelastmile.org/), a framework and blueprint worthy of emulation, prepares incarcerated individuals for successful reentry through business and technology training.

Their motto:

  
  > **Changing Lives Through Tech**

---

## Using a four-pillar approach.

---

Education | Vocation | Expansion | Reentry
---|---|---|---
Simple | Attainable | Lean | Record of Success 
**Served 460 students since '10** | **12 locations Ca, In, Ks, Ok** | **0% recidivism rate** | **National Avg. 55%**

## The People Problems
### **IT and the Digital Skills Gap**
Cloud Services, IT, and Machine Learning  are developing at break-neck speeds while driving faster growth and efficiency for businesses and society, but there is a lack of digital skills in the workforce.

---

### **Recidivism / Reentry**
Recidivism rates are at their worst levels on Earth due to drug wars beginning to end, legislation finally recognizing the gross over-incarceration that's been in place for nearly 40 years. 

While what was already an 
- __overcrowded__
- __underfunded__
- __exhausted reentry/community supervision__ model.
    
A model that's original intention was to assist the formerly incarcerated and serve as a conduit back to some sense of normalcy. As the newly released struggle with strengthening their psyche and overcoming stigma disease. 

It is was not instituted to play the role it currently holds. As the doorstop for the turnstile right back into the American [in]Justice System. 

It is the epitome of an open door policy, more aptly put, a revolving door policy.

---

> The board of Pardons and Paroles and all fifty states Departments of Community Supervision front, maintenance, and back doors, have all been stuck in gear for the better part of fifty years; right in line with the passing of The Civil Rights Act of Nineteen Hundred and Sixy Four. 

---

### **SUD & The Opioid Epidemic**
Making the connection with substance misuse, the opioid crisis, and recidivistic statistics is a simple Aristotle logic equation. 

Wars were claimed on Drugs. Non-violent, victimless crimes became felonious; carrying mandatory minimum discriminatory sentences. 

Causing addicts to become public enemy number one. 

In a socioeconmic war, that either, lost site of the intended target. Or never understood who to target from the onset.  

Each one is a seperate issue and seperately we continue to fail in fighting them. 

Once the string of logic is followed, the common threads become more obvious.

Those string can be seen tugging on the epidemic and substance use statistics. 
Their names; War on Drugs, and Stigma. 

---

> Preamble-Project is an impossible to refute evidence-based strategy establishing an absolute need for fighting the stigma disease. 

---

Finally, by bringing those problems together, the underlying issues (lack of opportunity / diminishing self-worth) will surface becoming more visible to the unaffected. Which is the inertia we seek. Allowing for replenishment of opportunity and equality for all sub-sectors of American Citizens. This will certainly create a long-lasting domino effect tilting the tides to the favor of the people . While further weakening and helping fuel the fire that is going to bring America to Drug War Ends. Just as prohibition finds its end. And We the People continue on demanding actual actionable alternative answers.
