# Preamble-Project

## We the people believe that opportunity, inclusion, and hope for the future, establish a more perfect union; not legislation, medication or further incarceration.

## Qualitative Goals
1. Bridge the skills gap by delivering readily available resources to provide the __applied digital skills training__ into our American prison systems, county jails, and juvenile detention centers.  Into the hands of our socioeconomically disadvantaged; a grossly under, and unemployed subsector of the US economy.
2. Leverage the same plant that, to this day, continues to be unjustly used to incarcerate over 600,000 Americans per year, as means to gainful employment, opportunity, economic stability, and improved pscyhe of the formerly incarcerated.
3. In making the problem the solution, the expected outcome is:
    - reduction of the illicit marijuana market
    - boost to the 
        - Medicinal, 
        - Recreational, and 
        - Whole herbaceous plant; hemp plant sector. 
    - further gains to what had been uncollected tax revenues.

### Non-Negotiables
1. Open source, open border, open for all as an always accessible, fully transparent repository on the github.com platform.
1.  All-inlcusive. Expect and respect diversity. A True Meritocracy.
1. Establish  and implement simple yet actionable measurables fueling data-driven Solutions.
1. Launch from Google Cloud Platform; full leverage of the platform and resources as to progressively deliver current and emerging technologies, utilize all that is machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, kubernetes, and Natural Language Processing. 
    - Chasing the Wind, llc has chosen to allocate all benefits from the Google Cloud for Startups program recently awarded are to be utilized in their entirety on the preamble-project, as a means to kickstart the launch, further extending while facilitating lean funding; simply put, a sustainable cannabis model.

## Will it work?
### [The Last Mile Project](https://thelastmile.org/), a framework and blueprint worthy of emulation, prepares incarcerated individuals for successful reentry through business and technology training.
Their motto:

  > **Changing Lives Through Tech**

## The People Problems
### **IT and the Digital Skills Gap**
Cloud Services, IT, and Machine Learning  are developing at break-neck speeds while driving faster growth and efficiency for businesses and society, but there is a lack of digital skills in the workforce.

### **Recidivism / Reentry**
Recidivism rates are at their worst levels on Earth due to drug wars beginning to end, legislation finally recognizing the gross over-incarceration that's been in place for nearly 40 years, and what was already an overcrowded, underfunded, exhausted reentry/community supervision platform that was only ever meant to assist folks; not keep them in the turnstile of the American [in]Justice revolving door policy currently stuck in gear. 

### **SUD & The Opioid Epidemic**
Making the connection with substance misuse, this opioid crisis, recidivism rates, and having opportunity on the endangered list is not all that difficult. Each one is a seperate issue altogether with moving variables. 

> An impossible to refute evidence-based need for fighting. 

Finally, from bringing those problems together, the underlying area and most actionable tactic is to replinish opportunity for the future as priority number one. This will most certainly create a long-lasting domino effect tilting the tides to our favor while weakening further as prohibition ends begins to rollout.
