### Qualitative Goals
---

1. Bridge the skills gap by delivering readily available resources to provide the __applied digital skills training__ into our American prison systems, county jails, and juvenile detention centers.  Into the hands of our socioeconomically disadvantaged; a grossly under, and unemployed subsector of the US economy.

2. Leverage the same plant that, to this day, continues to be unjustly used to incarcerate over 600,000 Americans per year, as means to gainful employment, opportunity, economic stability, and improved pscyhe of the formerly incarcerated.

3. In making the problem the solution, the expected outcome is:

    - reduction of the illicit marijuana market
    
    - boost to the 
    
        - Medicinal, 
        
        - Recreational, and

### __The People Problems__
---

---
#### IT and the Digital Skills Gap
---

Cloud Services, IT, and Machine Learning  are developing at break-neck speeds while driving faster growth and efficiency for businesses and society, but there is a lack of digital skills in the workforce.

---
#### Recidivism / Reentry
---

Recidivism rates are at their worst levels on Earth due to drug wars beginning to end, legislation finally recognizing the gross over-incarceration that's been in place for nearly 40 years. 

- While what was already an

    - __overcrowded__

    - __underfunded__

    - __exhausted reentry/community supervision__ model.

---  
> A model that's original intention was to assist the formerly incarcerated and serve as a conduit back to some sense of normalcy. As the newly released struggle with strengthening their psyche and overcoming stigma disease. 
---

---
> It was not instituted to play the role it currently holds. As the doorstop for the turnstile that has created what is otherwise known as the revolving door policy of the American Criminal [in]Justice System.
---

---
> The board of Pardons and Paroles and all fifty states Departments of Community Supervision front, middle, and rear entries, have all been stuck in motion for the better part of fifty years; right in line with the passing of The Civil Rights Act of Nineteen Hundred and Sixy Four. Just as Drug Wars found their beginnings. 
---

---
#### **SUD & The Opioid Epidemic**
---

Making the connection with substance misuse, the opioid crisis, and recidivistic statistics is a simple Aristotelian logic equation. 

- Wars were claimed on Drugs. 
 
    - Non-violent, victimless crimes became felonious; carrying mandatory minimum discriminatory sentences. 

        - Causing addicts to become public enemy number one. 

        - With America in the throes of a socioeconomic war, that either, lost sight of the intended target, or never understood who to target from the onset.  

            - Each one is a __seperate issue__ and _seperately we continue to fail in fighting them._ 

                - Once the string of logic is followed, the common threads become more obvious.

                - Those strings can be seen tugging on the epidemic, substance use, and recidivistic statistics. 
                  
                  - Their names
                  
                      - War on Drugs.
                  
                      - Stigma.
                  
---
> Preamble-Project is an impossible to refute evidence-based strategy establishing an absolute need for fighting the stigma disease. 
---

__Finally__, by bringing those problems together, the underlying issues (lack of opportunity / diminishing self-worth) will surface becoming more visible to the unaffected. Which is the inertia we seek. Allowing for __replenishment of opportunity__ and __equality for all sub-sectors of North American Citizens__. 

**The hypothesis** is these events will help create a long-lasting domino effect; tilting the tides to the favor of the people . While further weakening, and helping to fuel the fire that is *going to bring America to Drug War Ends.* 

__Just as prohibition finds its end.__

__And We the People continue demanding actual, actionable, alternative answers.__

#### (16 Nov. 2019) Latest Updates
---

---
##### _SXSW 2020 Pitch registration closes at midnight CST in less than 48 hours. And as a lean startup, we need to source the $220 registration fee if that it is in our plans.

STAY TUNED! Chase the Dream! Join the Team!_

#### (21 Nov 2019) Latest Updates (Real-time Journey of Continuous Improvement and constant personal, professional, and organizational development).
---

1. __SXSW waived the registration fees (🙏🏽)!__ (_See faith line 269).
    
    - Not just once but twice! We were late with entering and had some technical and personal difficulties due to having my daughter in my lap and facing the deadline (with an opportunity of a lifetime sitting on the screens in front of me). __A most gracious gesture by them that we never expected or asked for. So South by Southwest, from us to y'all, Thank You for that underserved favor!__
    
2. (24 Nov, 2019) [4,682 CB Rank Last check ](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/c-brennan-poole "Profile created on 9 Nov 2019 and we're up over 360,000 spots with a __ethical whole-self growth hack approach__.")

3. The tech publication Red Herring has also extended an invite to register for the Top 100 Startups. Still need to do our due diligence before deciding on that.

4. CBD Group has reached out about aligning or acquiring. Doubt they'd acquire as my number is set. $7,172,017. Birthday of my only daughter and epitome of everything undeserved kindness stands for: Miss ShiloHisGrace; Shiloh Grace Poole.

5. Able to capture **$10,000 thanks to  Digital Ocean and The Y Combinator Startup School program we particpated in earlier this year.**

---
##### __Seriously need a CTO AND__ somehow figure out how to skyrocket progression of technical proficiencies; to be able to take all this momentum and convert it into an MVP and scalable framework / could make for one amazing business pitch and almost immediate profitability if somehow we align and coalesce with the Chief Technical Equity Holder. __FAITH__.
