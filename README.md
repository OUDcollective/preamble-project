`preamble-project` `new venture beginnings`<br>

The  white privilege to disadvantaged minority seven year sojourn led to an epiphany, small business ownership, and wholly ethical, effectively disruptive digital self that is the co-author to the preamble-project. 


## Preface


**I, C Brennan Poole, Principal Chief & Creative Strategist** as of 14 July, 2020 *still sit here emphatically and unequivocally convinced that if somehow, someway, someone would take to funding this venture, recidivism, revolving doors, and substance misuse would finally take a turn into a manageable, attainable, digression in turn effectiveley signaling an end to the corporatocracy and outright hypocritical politicking that has been fueling whole earth with its back-room dealings, and commercial interest constituents lies. For far too long. And whether willful ignorance is the underlying complicitness, or outright caught with hand in US cookie jar; full of unsuspecting homo sapiens. That complicitness is no longer an option. It can no longer be tolerated, and must be forever eradicated. Starting at the head of the snake; while using the dirty money hoarded by corporate interest, pyramid schemes, big techs egregious and downright unethical data thievery. Thieving to leverage and subliminally affect billions of mindless feeders. As well as the legacy of multi-generational juris—  where's prudence? Temperance? How about Vengeance? Oh yes. It's time to act. Pandemic was the flare this preamble was attempting to speak to. Self - admit, failure was expected however.  This is but a glimpse into a single man's web of truths. It's dysfunctional. As am I. Unorthodox. In every sense of the word. The o.u.d. collective is but solo collective. DUNS calls for 7 of me. It's mental health and manic-persuaded. Own it. I do. But a caste out, thown out, forgotten completely about detective of conscience. Hacking with unfettered truth causation. a personal mental health master peace.*


Best, <br>

## Preamble-Project
`to bring logiC–to–Stigma; sH—IT–'stics`<br>

> We the people believe that opportunity, inclusion, and hope for the future, establish a more perfect union; not legislation, medication or North American incarceration.

### Year One Milestones  

Oh and Thanks! For having a look see at Chasing the Wind, LLC Preamble-Project. It's a tiny peace of self-realized digital real estate. In a corner of the vast expanse that is the GitHub domain. Jekyll Pages architectured. With a [Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike (CC BY-SA) International 4.0 Fair Cultural Works](https://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0 "anyone else find it odd that the one thing we are taught to plagiarize is the licensing that prevents plagiarism?") licensing. Some rights reserved. Now onto all that is this Preamble to what certainly is and will someday become a feasible dream.

#### First 50 Weeks

> The first 50 weeks can be summed up in four words. Fail Huge. **Continuous Improvement**.

[Jump to Top](https://github.com/OUDcollective/preamble-project#table-of-contents "Usability Friendly, at least, attempting to be")
#### Week 51-Present

> Things got worthy of sharing around the 50th week into premature business incorporations. After using the world's most widely trafficked Venture Capital API to put everything that is Chasing the Wind - and my idea of a proper business model - to the ultimate test. My goal immediately after publishing - was simple. Make the Top 100,000 for organization CB Rank. Then consider seeking funding. That was about 250,000 spots higher than when I was initially ranked. And I'd crush my personal goal in less than two days. 
> In retrospect - rather than winging it - and playing the game that is the world wide web - I should have dialed back - and laid out a framework for all the attention I continue to receive.

### Founded November 15, 2018

---

Using gains made from stock purchase into [CV Sciences (OTC: CVSI:US)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVSI/ "CV Sciences is currently pennies off the 52 week LOY having lost over 80% in market value from where we sold in 2018 November. CV Sciences is on a mission to improve the well‐being of people and planet. They believe that the future of hemp is unlimited. Through innovative and responsible application of science, they strive to enhance the prosperity and health of their employees, customers, and communities. they are committed to pioneering the Cannabidiol Evolution as the leading producer of quality hemp phytocannabinoid rich products. Someday I'll be able to share why this is so significant to the Chasing the Wind story."). Formation as a legal entity was made prematurely (long before having a clue exactly what CTW was going to be, much less offer as a service or product) with profits from an ethical *phytocannabinoid rich, whole plant hemp* manufacturer and *cannabidiol company*, as a means to **motivate** and help keep an **eye on the prize.** 

> Stocks were purchased in the .30 cent range and sold above in mid $5's about 10 and a half months later.     
>
> CVSI had a great idea in attempting to *attack smokeless tobacco (snuff / chew / dip / spit) and having a **former MLB athlete** up in the C-Suite. 
>
> **Real-life. Real People Problems. Really big ideas. And feasible dreams.**    

- Three weeks after purchasing the stock, life as I once knew it, would change.     
    - Forevever.    
          - Ultimately, for the better.

## VISION 

---

**Deliver a truly transparent, cloud architecture**, utilizing **state-of-the-art emerging technologies** and a common good approach to partner with the private and liaison to the public sectors in order to deliver these digital solutions into North American institutions (prisons, jails, juveniles, centers, schools and shelters). 

**Putting alternative answers *like hemp health* to an altruistic test**; serving as the *common ground topic* for our people who are in most need of the ability to capture the ***opportunity*** that is the ***North American Dream*** (i.e. socioeconomic disadvantaged minorities, disabled, and our freedom fighters, United States Veterans); in effect addressing the most egregious problems; caused by an unwinnable war that has only worsened over the past forty some odd years; North American (and becoming global) people problems, which are far too prevalent on our continent today.

> The problems, continue to be attacked separately. While the schism continues to seperate.

#### CITE SEEING

    Competition for high-skill workers will increase, while displacement will be concentrated mainly on low-skill workers, continuing a
trend that has exacerbated income inequality and reduced middle-wage jobs. [Mckinsey.com quoting from matrials by the World Economic Forum](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/inequality-a-persisting-challenge-and-its-implications)
---
    
    The US needs more workers and needs to do a better job of educating, preparing, and retraining the potential workers it already has to ensure that all Americans are positioned to prosper in the face of future economic competition. Critically, workforce advantages the  US once enjoyed can only be rebuilt by better accessing the full diversity of our available talent— including from groups whose       > potential contributions the US has failed to fully support and cultivate in the past.

### Recidivism / Reentry

---

> Recidivism rates are at their worst levels on Earth due to drug wars beginning to end, legislation finally recognizing the gross over-incarceration that's been in place for nearly 40 years. 

---

- The causes cited for relapse into criminal behavior include
    - A failure of prisons to rehabilitate
    - Addiction,
    - Lack of job skills, 
    - Lack of educational upon entry and further stagnation while incarcerated,
        - Soft skills oftentimes cease to exist or
            - Have deteriorated to the point of near non-existance 
    - Lack of sustainable funding upon release first day out with no actionable plans in place to immediately establish a fair, working income. 
        - Environment either failed to improve while incarcerated or 
            - Has further deteriorated due to burden incarceration creates to those that have supporting families on the outside,
                - No family / social support system in place,
                - Socioeconomics and the underlying disadvantages increased with new offense and employment gaps,
                - **Stigma** that comes with criminality and the all-encompassing bucket of blame that society tends to associate that word with (especially in the current epidemic environment, associating addiction with criminality as an automatic, whereas is nothing more than stereotypical assumption). 
Overall, rates of recidivism have been going up, according to the [Bureau of Justice Statistics:](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=17 "Rates range from 43-mid 80's at various stages of reentry, the longer you're out worse the odds.")

- While what was already an    
    - __overcrowded__    
    - __underfunded__    
    - __exhausted reentry/community supervision__ model.

A model that's original intention was to assist the formerly incarcerated and serve as a conduit back to some sense of normalcy. As the newly released struggle with strengthening their psyche and overcoming stigma disease. 

> It was not instituted to play the role it currently holds. As the doorstop for the turnstile that has created what is otherwise known as the revolving door policy of the American Criminal [in]Justice System.

### **SUD & The Opioid Epidemic**

- Making the connection with substance misuse, the opioid crisis, and recidivistic statistics is a simple Aristotelian logic equation. 
    1. Wars were claimed on Drugs. 
    2. Non-violent, victimless crimes became felonious; carrying mandatory minimum discriminatory sentences. 
        - Causing addicts to become public enemy number one. 
        - With America in the throes of a socioeconomic war, that either, lost sight of the intended target, or never understood who to target from the onset.  
            1. Each one is a __seperate issue__ and _seperately we continue to fail in fighting them._ 
                - Once the string of logic is followed, the common threads become more obvious.
                - Those strings can be seen tugging on the epidemic, substance use, and recidivistic statistics. 
                    1. Their names
                      - War on Drugs.
                      - Stigma.

---

> Preamble-Project is an impossible to refute evidence-based strategy establishing an absolute need for fighting the stigma disease.

- __FINALLY__, by bringing these **people problems** together, the **underlying issues
    - *lack of Opportunity, and 
    - Diminishing Self-Worth* will surface becoming more visible to the unaffected. 
    - The inertia we seek. 
        1. Allowing for 
            - __Replenishment of Opportunity__ and 
            - __Equality for all sub-sectors of North American Citizens__.**

## Market Research

---

> TK! We started by conducting market research on a broad selection of suppliers. By looking at five different
companies suppliers across the country, we were able to analyze the data collected in
order to help us determine the elements that would help us in making the preamble-project a lasting success. The
categories we focused on included price, compliant marketing and customer engagement, distribution, product mix,
and high concentration certificates of analysis.

In addition, we spoke with companies in various stages of their **life cycle**, *some only a months old while others being first to market.*

The following are reports from each company summarizing the **key points that aligned with our objective:**

```

TBD
