## [Writing a Business Plan](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/writing-a-business-plan/ " Written by the Sequoia")

Company purpose Start here: define your company in a single declarative sentence. 

This is harder than it looks. 

It’s easy to get caught up listing features instead of communicating your mission. 

Problem Describe the pain of your customer. 

How is this addressed today and what are the shortcomings to current solutions. 

Solution Explain your eureka moment. 

Why is your value prop unique and compelling? 

Why will it endure? 

And where does it go from here? 

Why now? 

The best companies almost always have a clear why now? 

Nature hates a vacuum—so why hasn’t your solution been built before now? 

Market potential Identify your customer and your market. 


Some of the best companies invent their own markets.
Competition / alternatives Who are your direct and indirect competitors. 

Show that you have a plan to win. 

Business model How do you intend to thrive? 

Team Tell the story of your founders and key team members. 

Financials If you have any, please include. Vision If all goes well, what will you have built in five years?
