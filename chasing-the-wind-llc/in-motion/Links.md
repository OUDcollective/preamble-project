2. Cannabusiness Logistics | Cannabusiness Logistics.com 
    - Original concept and what led me to infiltrate the cannabis industry. 
            - I had been attempting to convince *friends* and former colleagues that there was a serious opportunity and pain point within the cannabis B2B industry since Oct 2018. 
            - Because no one acted due to being busy with their main projects, I took it upon myself with an agreement in place that should I bring back some actionable opportunity, they'd join up and take up the cause with me. 
            - I worked on Cannabusiness Logistics from February-March but ultimately would sit it to the side (even though I held the domain name) UNTIL around July of Twenty 19 when I began 
                    - Networking and 
                    - Learning about the current hemp operations at the farm level over on the Leafedin profile. 
                - At that point, I began using my knowledge of 
                            - Process Implementation, 
                            - Kaizen Leadership and 
                            - Continuous Improvement.
