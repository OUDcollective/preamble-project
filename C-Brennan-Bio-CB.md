# Casey Brennan Poole 
## 10 May, 1983 
### Chief Principal 
### Chasing the Wind, LLC 
### Father to Shiloh Grace Born 17 July, 2017

Brennan was born in Albany, Georgia approximately 35 miles from the multi-generation one thousand acre cotton, peanut, corn, and soy plantation his Grandfather (Homer Iverson) and Grandmother (Mary Jane) would last farm after having nurtured the soil for over 60 years. 

## Jon Darrell Poole
His father was a terminal manager for Roadway Express Inc in Columbus, GA, Albany, GA, and Dothan, AL. After unfortunate personnel changes were made with the Yellow / Roadway merger in the early 2000's he would go on to lead as the Service Center manager in Mobile, AL. He would finish his career and unfortunately, the end of his time here on earth, serving in the same role at the Decatur, AL terminal; where he would win several awards and make his name in the storied organization. 

Darrell Poole was diagnosed with early on-set Parkinson's and Stage IV Colorectal Cancer unexpectedly and out-of-nowhere in the summer of 2011. By December 2015, the disease would ultimately end his life. The only relief he found in that time and while going through the aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments was in Cannabis Sativa. Because of the time C Brennan and Darrell had to discuss this, it has since been Brennan's mission in life to enter industry and honor his amazing father by sharing his story and offering the cannabis industry all the help he can possibly give them with the lifetime of logistics and transportation knowledge / business acumen he has come to attain.

## Tamara Denise 
C Brennan's mother was an hourly assembly worker at Ford Motor Company. At all of 4 foot 13 and a half inches and never more than 115 pounds she would ultimately be forced into premature medical retirement and permanent disability after having foregone two unsuccessful upper back / lower neck spinal surgeries. With matching carpal tunnel corrective surgeries in between the two neck procedures. She has only very recently found cannabidiol and is currently on a regimen attempting to curb the narcotic pain medication American prescribing practices have forced her dependency to for the better part of 25 years. 

## Studies 
C Brennan would graduate from Salem High School, a National School of Excellence with a Dual, College Preparatory and Business Administration, degree after serving as a legal assistant his junior year for a well-known law-firm in Dothan, AL.
He would meet his brother at The University of West Georgia for his freshman year of undergrad school. Tthe following spring C made the decision to pave his own path enrolling in the Business Program at The J Mack Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University's main campus in the heart of Downtown Atlanta. Achieving Faculty Scholar with a 4.0 Grade Point Average his 3rd year and the Dean's List with a 3.50 GPA his 4th, he'd follow that up graduating with a BBA in Operations Management in May of 2006 from what was then the #2 ranked Operations Management / Managerial Sciences program in America. 

## Career 
By 27 C Brennan found himself holding the title as the youngest Operations Manager in the less-than-load trucking industry at Saia LTL Freight Inc. Saia is an international less-than-load and logistics management provider with a 163 terminal network billions in revenues. Brennan had 400+ associates, 200+ line and city drivers, and no less than 10 supervisors of responsibility reporting directly to him. The terminal is the largest and most heavily trafficked facility in the Saia network. 

In less than a year Brennan helped institute the company's inaugural Dock-to-Driver program. Developing a pathway from P/T associate to a driver career for dozens of Atlanta Dock team members. He also implemented the companies initial Quality Matters campaign.
Using those programs with the education he had earned along with The Toyota Way Management Principles he wrote his Operations Strategy case study on, Brennan would help turn the Atlanta Dock into a profitable break-bulk facility again.

## Life Events 
Brennan would be side lined by a non-fault car accident that would be the cause of the same exact spinal cord injury his mother suffers from (C4-C7 cervical radiculopathy). The accident and injury would end his career while in his prime, at the age of 29. 
He, like many others in situations like this, would struggle mightily and internally with the reality. Ultimately however, it was what he now feels was part of his purpose all along as it has led him to Chief Principal of Chasing the Wind, LLC. The life experiences from his days in diapers on his Grandaddy's farm, playing on the combine, and steering the tractor; the time spent shucking corn, and picking peas with his Saint of Grandmother Miss Mary Jane as she would hum hymnals and speak on Moses & Joseph, wilderness walk pioneers; the 20 plus years spent with his Daddy learning logistics; the experience he and his Mother share having been chronic pain patients, with serious spinal cord injuries, have all culminated into what Brennan now sees as the weaving of his joy & suffering journey. Now all coming together to help mold him as an example for others and Chief Principal of Chasing the Wind, LLC.

## Chasing the Wind
He's bootstrapped Chasing the Wind, LLC business. Been forced and chosen to pivot several times over. Wanted to walk away and call it quits more times than he can remember. But his journey and daughter, Shiloh Grace, have given him the strength needed to press on. 
Brennan found acceptance into Y Combinator's Startup School as an unfunded, unmonetized plan with no website or partner. 3 months later, he would then be accepted into Google Cloud for Startups. The past year has been the most self-realized of his 36 amassing no less than 40 MOOC certifications.

## Preparedness
Brennan has spent thousands of hours studying, self-criticizing, networking, and assessing industry pain points. In doing so, he has an acute understanding of the industry. He's developing a comprehensive attack plan with multi-pronged objectives and a unified end goal that aims directly at, not just the cannabis industry pain points, but also the biggest problems we face in America. The model is as lean as they come having operated on what was originally a $51.37 budget and completely organic, authentic grassroots, homegrown cannabis campaign. 

## Longview
Brennan aims to fully leverage today's emerging technologies by hosting the domains he has been accumulating on the Google Cloud Platform. He plans to deliver digital solutions into our nation's prison system teaching remotely. Then offer gainful employment to non-violent offenders upon release. Starting at first day out. With a mentor agreement plan already mapped out. Allowing an actual, actionable pathway to best-in-class pay & gainful employment in the world's fastest growing industry, the Cannabis and Industrial Hemp Space. And he will help develop the all-new supply-chain.
