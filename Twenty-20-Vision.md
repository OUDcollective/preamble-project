New to research & web development. Launching website aiming for Opioid Epidemic Solutions and Drafting the Resolution.

__I AM__  
Not naive to believe that one can just break into this field. 

__I WAS__ 
For about a week but quickly came to my sense after realizing how little I knew about web technologies and the obstacles that exist within the canna-business industry. I have been and will continue putting in the personal and professional work. While studying and targeting the prose in order to develop my style and copy, both  effectively, and legally. 

__A BACK INJURY__  
From a non-fault car accident led me to pain management in lieu of a double fusion back surgery on my upper back/lower neck (C4-C7) and in less than 8 months I managed to go from not even being on prescription medication to dependent, misusing, & finally abusing Oxycodone. This caused me to have Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). I spent five years fighting and failing to the disease. And the last two self-realizing, self-working, and fighting the toxic stigma disease at every crossroad I happen upon.

### JOY FROM SUFFERING JOURNEY

- __16 Dec, 2014__ I Lost my Father to Colorectal Cancer and Early onset Parkinson's Disease. 

- __17 July, 2017__Become a first-time father to a beautiful baby girl born 7/17/17.

First cousin. Who was also a first friend. 
- Having passed away as a direct result of the Opioid Epidemic and Opioid Use Disorder. 
Career as an Operations Manager in the less-than-load transportation industry.

__MANAGED__ 
To achieve the title that matched my college studies prior to turning to thirty. While being tasked with managing 400+ associates and running the 24/6 Atlanta break terminal operations. And finally, I was sent to prison for simple possession.

__CERTAIN__ 
The profound understanding I have of OUD, from the perspective of a child whose mother suffers from it, as well as having fallen victim to the disease myself, gives me as much hands on real-life experience as anyone out there studying, researching, and attempting to fight the disease.

__ HOLD__ a fresh perspective and am completely cognizant of the American [in] Justice system as well as reentry and recidivism issues stemming from the national prison policy. 

 __AIM TO ARTICULATE__ 
That knowledge to shine a light for the laywomen & men as well as the professionals & institutions. In order to help facilitate a solution to the Opioid Epidemic. Hopefully, someday even 

 __COLLECTIVELY CO-PEN__  
> The Opioid Epidemic Resolution: Article 05TEN19.

 __HAVING BEEN__  
Unsuccessful in attaining _gainful_ employment (equivalent to the nearly thirty years of reputable and recognized education; along with actual, on-the-job experience, I possess) for thirteen months and have been _grossly underemployed_ for seven years now. That time frame dates back to the second week of February 2013 and 

__THE FIRST__  
Arrest for _simple possession_ of Class II & IV prescription medications. Namely _Oxycodone & Diazepam_. 

__THE SECOND__ 
Arrest occurred one year to the week later.

All three for simple possession.

## __MY LIFE'S MISSION__ 

- Starts with taking back control of the career. 

---

THIRTY-SIX YEARS OF LIFE EXPERIENCE, 

-  A pre-existing knowledge of the efficacy of cannabis, my Father having passed of Early Onset Parkinsons' coupled with End Stage Colorectal Cancer (who would stand behind and confirm that the Full Spectrum efficacy of cannabis Sativa was the only relief he'd know for the last three years of his life), and my own personal knowledge of the power of cannabidiol; after nearly succombing and turning back to pills only six months after release (stigma and the sentence you are put on post release is harder than any time I've ever known, combined) has helped me find confidence successfully taking on the wrongs I'm now righting through writing. 

> SUCCESSFUL DEFEAT 
- Of a man-made disease that has killed more people than Vietnam OR World War II is going to take a whole hell of a lot more resources and creative problem solving than I could ever even attempt to assemble. 

---

### ACCESS 

- To powerful information isn't always open source. 

AS BEAUTIFUL AS 

- Open-source is, it is fractured, tedious to gain efficient knowledge of best practices and workflow processes, especially while attempting to be market, brand build, and keep up with current events and emerging  technologies developing at never-before-seen rates. 

---

#### ADVERTISING on social media for an unpopular topic like Opioid Epidemic Education isn't a free service and discussing it effectively / objectively is all but impossible. .

    - Consider what I have had to do just to find any sense of comfort or audience in effectively discussing the issue:

        1. All accounts started at zero. 
        2. Any attempt at teaming up (and I have had interest from candidates with far biggernetworks and much better skillsets) has been squashed as soon as I give them the whole she-bang (letters similar to this one right here).

> Never again will I attempt to hide my past, make excuses for my own shortcomings, or look at it as anything less than my life's purpose. 

---

#### BELIEVE 

- That after approximately 6-12 (I wrote this on June 19, 2019 it's now been 6 months and 3 weeks since project inception) conservatively, I will be able to monetize my works through my website(s) and pivot possibilities.

### CHASING THE WIND 
Is with a ZERO dollar ad spend, no team, not even a site until 18 Nov, 2019 and a ~$32.00~ $2151.37 bootstrapped, teamless budget. 
The thought of working as non-profit strictly under grants and fund raising/charitable donations crossed is open to discussion. However, business and operations is what I know. I'm extremely passionate about both, the business model, and the cannabis community as a whole.
