## PROJECT START
### NUMBER ONE
---
#### > 31 OCT, TWENTY 19  ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE

***NOTE:***  
 -  At onset, I had very little familiarity with the crunchbase platform and was unaware of the power it possesses  in building one's personal brand. I finally realized the potential 10 days into the original hack; 
        
- ***Hence the reason for the second start date.***
### NUMBER TWO
---
#### > 9 NOV, TWENTY 19 FOUNDER PROFILE

***NOTE:***  
    -  Sometime between Monday evening 25 Nov, 2019 and Tuesday AM around 0200EST 26 Nov the algorithm would dump my profile from the
            
 - **Top 5,000**  
-    **CB Rank 4,197** was the **best high** I would capture;
        -    **Unfortunately**, 
                - *Emotions or 
                - Ego* 
             - caused me not to take the screenshot at that mark; 
        - **The next time** I would look check the progress a few hours after getting off the phone on 
            - Monday Night 25 Nov Twenty 19 or
            - Early Tuesday AM 26 Nov Twenty 19 with

   - **520,000's** range 
         - I was livid when I saw this, and failed to remain objective by getting a screenshot;
                - Somewhere on my **disorganized, pos** *Budget brand PC*, I have a screen shot in the 
   - **400,000s** then a few hours later in the

> *1/3 Working theories is that by adding my entire first name here, the algorithm would then associate me with my entire life's digital footprint and discredit me from 4,197 to 500,000's (I suppose for not being a serial entrepreneur or damn **do-it-all digital millennial** much longer than the past three to four months)*

##THE PROFILE     

> **NOTE:** *THIS IS A DYNAMIC BIO IMPLEMENTING CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT REAL-TIME AS THAT IS OUR CORE VALUE; IT IS BEING ADJUSTED, FINE-TUNED, AND IMPROVED ON DAILY; BIG PART OF THE HACK).
Brennan was born in Albany, Georgia approximately 35 miles from the third generation cotton, peanut, corn, & soy plantation his Grandfather (Homer Iverson) & Grandmother (Mary Jane) farmed for 60+ years.*

---
### DAD 
His father left the farm for business school at Georgia Southwestern after graduating from Worth County High outside their hometown of Isabella, GA. Upon completion he found Roadway Express after a brief stint with Georgia Pacific. He'd go on to be named Terminal Manager in Columbus and Albany, GA; then Dothan, AL.  

After personnel changes from the Yellow Freight / Roadway merger in early 2000's he became Service Center manager in Mobile, AL for Federal Express Freight Division.

### CANCER and PARKINSON'S 
---
Darrell finished his career, and what would unfortunately be the end of his time here on earth, serving in the same role at the Decatur, AL brand new award winning break terminal.

He would win several awards and make his name with the storied organization all while battling for his life, but work gave him purpose and he found solace with his new FedEx family.

Darrell Poole was diagnosed with early on-set Parkinson's & Stage IV Colorectal Cancer unexpectedly the summer of '11. Four days after his 57th birthday on 16 Dec '14, he went as peaceful as one could after fighting a relentless prognosis for three pain filled years. He would breathe his last where he had hoped it would happen. At home. With his family.
### WHOLE HERBACEOUS PLANT EFFICACY
---

> *The only relief he found during his battle, dealing with aggressive chemo, radiation, and ineffective invasive surgeries, was in the plant medicine that is Cannabis Sativa. C Brennan knew a little about the plant's efficacy and offered to help Darrell acquire some if needed, immediately his Dad stated that the plant was his only pain relief and appetite assistant, and that he had enough for the time. That conversation and the truth it entails about the herbaceous plant is what drives Brennan to this day. He's made it his mission in life to enter industry so he can honor his amazing father (and the business man everyone knew him as).*

---
### MOM
---
C Brennan's mother was a UAW member (his Dad, a non-union Manager) and assembly worker at Ford Motor Company in Hapeville, GA. At 4 foot 13 and a half inches and never more than 115 pounds, she'd eventually be forced into a premature medical retirement. Followed by an extremely difficult to live off permanent disability status by the Social Security Administration. This all came to light after having endured two unsuccessful upper back / lower neck spinal surgeries (C4-C7) with double carpal tunnel corrective surgeries on each wrist between the neck surgeries. She only recently found phytocannabinoid rich therapy. She's begun a regimen attempting to curb the narcotic medication American prescribing practices have forced her dependency to for the better part of 25 years.
> Known as YaYa to her grandchildren, she is the epitome of a loving Mom and Grandmother.


# C BRENNAN POOLE 
---
C Brennan, a graduate of Salem High in Conyers, GA; holds a Dual, College Prep. & Accounting Principles Technical Diploma from the National School of Excellence. He represented Northview High (Dothan, AL) as a 2-time competitor in the Future Business Leaders of America.


#### WEST GEORGIA
---
Meeting up with his big brother in '01, C's undergrad studies began at The University of West Georgia.


#### GEORGIA STATE
---
Needing to write his own way, that summer C chose to enroll at Georgia State University's internationally ranked BBA program at J Mack Robinson College of Business located in the heart of Downtown Atlanta. He was named a 3rd year Faculty Scholar & 4th year member of the Dean's List.
    
    - ROBINSON COLLEGE OF BUSINESS
        - Brennan holds a **BBA in Ops Mgmt. Class of 2006**. *J Mack Robinson* boasted the #2 ranked Ops Mgmt. program in the US that year and the specialization demands a 20% premium to this date.

#### RAT RACE SUCCESS
---
At 27, C Brennan became youngest Operations Manager for a Top 10 Fortune ranked LTL freight carrier, with a 166 terminal North American footprint & billions in revenue.

His team (100 Freight Handlers, 6 clerks, 200+ line and city drivers, 6 supervisors per shift) and terminal (Atlanta Dock) is both, the largest, and most heavily trafficked dock in the Saia network. In less than a year Brennan would institute the inaugural Dock-to-Driver program and implemented their initial Quality Matters campaign.

Using those programs, with the BBA / Business acumen he attained in conjunction with The Toyota Way Management Principles he wrote his case study on while at State, Brennan helped turn the ATL Dock back into a profitable facility. The ATL dock & Saia won several awards including:

#### THE INFAMOUS ACCIDENT
---
**In June 2012**, a non-fault car accident would sideline and change his life's course. *Causing a spinal injury identical to Mom's (C4-C7 cervical radiculopathy). His worst nightmare and an umpromising prognosis.* 

**The accident and injury** halted what was a fast-track to the executive track. While in his prime. At twenty-nine. He, like many others in situations like this, struggled to understand the meaning. Losing purpose for awhile & internalizing his anger. 

**Ultimately**, it was all what he now sees as part of his life's purpose. Founding of  Chasing the Wind, LLC.

Life experiences from diaper days on Grandpa's farm. Riding on the combine and steering the tractor. Time spent shucking and creaming silver queen corn with Grandma (Ms Mary Jane). As she would hum & story tell sojourns of Moses & Joseph; masters of the wilderness walk. Plus, the 30 years spent with his Daddy; learning logistics. And finally, the pain he shares with his Mama, both having been chronic pain patients with spine injuries, have culminated into Brennan's personal joy from suffering journey.
